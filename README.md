Initial project plan:

Week1: 
1. Reseaarch Iris Dataset
2. Get Iris DataSet (download to readme)
3. Research websites/forums on ways to analyze the dataset
4. Decision on final plan: MyAnalysis Plan- what attributes will be analysed/ how it will be presented/what histograms/ what are x & y for scattterplots (loook for correlations)
5. Research examples of python code to analyse data (Fisher data set or similar), code repositories, python forums
Week 2:
6. Begin writing the code:
7. Pull the data set to VSC file (text file?)
8. Write program to error check
9. Create a simpler dasta set file to check
10. Write program to:
11. pull the data set
12. Write python program to define: analyse the data
Week 3:
13. Write python program to create histograms
14. Write python program to create scatter=plots
15. Run program
16. Degbug
Week 4: 
17. Look for ways to make code more elegant
18. Create screenshots of histograms/scatterplots
19. Paste screenshots to repository 
20. Update ReadMe file
Week 5: comntingency
