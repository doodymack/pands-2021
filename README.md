Project: Make a project that will analyse the iris data set, this project is worth 50% of your grade for this course.


Initial project plan:

Week1: 
1. Reseaarch Iris Dataset- complete
2. Get Iris DataSet (download to readme) -complete
3. Research websites/forums on ways to analyze the dataset
4. Decision on final plan: MyAnalysis Plan- what attributes will be analysed/ how it will be presented/what histograms/ what are x & y for scattterplots (loook for correlations)
5. Research examples of python code to analyse data (Fisher data set or similar), code repositories, python forums
Week 2:
6. Begin writing the code:
7. Pull the data set to VSC file (text file?)
8. Write program to error check
9. Create a simpler dasta set file to check
10. Write program to:
11. pull the data set
12. Write python program to define: analyse the data
Week 3:
13. Write python program to create histograms
14. Write python program to create scatter=plots
15. Run program
16. Degbug
Week 4: 
17. Look for ways to make code more elegant
18. Create screenshots of histograms/scatterplots
19. Paste screenshots to repository 
20. Update ReadMe file
Week 5: comntingency


What is the Fisher Dataset (Wikipedia): 
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[3]
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
i.e.for 1.Iris setosa; 2. Iris virginica and 3. Iris versicolor:
measurements of:  sepal length-cm; sepal width-cm; petal length-cm; petal width-cm
