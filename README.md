List of references used in the weekly problems and general further reading from weekly lectures and labs (Note- 'Automate the boring stuff with Python' was printed -all 480 pages enabled by work printer-I found this a good read when sick of screentime and/or internet is down):

PROJECT PAGES:

CD..#
Project: Make a project that will analyse the iris data set, this project is worth 50% of your grade for this course.


Initial project plan:

Week1: 
1. Reseaarch Iris Dataset- complete
2. Get Iris DataSet (download to readme) -complete
3. Research PANDAS- do the week 11. Research external sources-complete
4. Create a test file similar to fisdher data set and start tp 'play' with it- record learnings for readme -ongoing
5. Research websites/forums on ways to analyze the dataset- ongoing
6. Decision on final plan: MyAnalysis Plan- what attributes will be analysed/ how it will be presented/what histograms/ what are x & y for scattterplots (loook for correlations)
7. Research examples of python code to analyse data (Fisher data set or similar), code repositories, python forums- 05 Apr- ongoing .  reference file created
Week 2:
8. Begin writing the code: -05 Apr started.
9. Pull the data set to VSC file (text file?)-completed
10. Write program to error check
11. Create a simpler data set file to check
12. Write program to:
13. pull the data set
14. Write python program to define: analyse the data
Week 3:
15. Write python program to create histograms
16. Write python program to create scatter=plots
17. Run program
18. Degbug
Week 4: 
19. Look for ways to make code more elegant
20. Create screenshots of histograms/scatterplots
21. Paste screenshots to repository 
22. Update ReadMe file
Week 5: comntingency


What is the Fisher Dataset (Wikipedia): 
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The dataset, contains three plant species (setosa, virginica, versicolor) and four features measured for each sample. These quantify the morphologic variation of the iris flower in its three species, all measurements given in centimeters.


2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[3]

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
i.e.for 1.Iris setosa; 2. Iris virginica and 3. Iris versicolor:
measurements of:  sepal length-cm; sepal width-cm; petal length-cm; petal width-cm

How to write an Algorithm- Useful for Project Architecture?

1. Identify the Inputs
2. Identify the Processes
3. Identify the Outputs
4. Develop a HIPO Chart

Step 1: identify the data:

- What data do I need?
- How will I get the data?
- In what format will the data be?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE PROCESSES
- How can I manipulate data to produce meaningful results?

STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE OUTPUTS
-What outputs do I need to return to the user?
-What format should the outputs take?

STEP 4: DEVELOP A HIPO CHART
- Hierarchy of Inputs, Processes and Outputs
- Used to develop requirements, construct the design, and support implementation
- Break the problem into smaller more manageable parts (i.e. Divide and Conquer)
- What inputs do the modules need?
- What processes need to happen in the modules?
- What outputs are produced by the modules?
