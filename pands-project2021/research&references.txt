Summary abstract: 
The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set 
introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. 
Data created by Edgar Anderson to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
Two of the species attributes
Iris setosa, Iris virginica,Iris versicolor
50 samples of each 3 species comprised the dataset:
Four features were measured from each sample measured in centimeters:
1. the length of the petals
2. the length of the sepals
3. the width of the petals
4. the width of the sepals
Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model
to distinguish the species from each other.
LDA:  Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant,
a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that
 characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
 Also known as 'normal discriminant analysis' (NDA), or 'discriminant function analysis'
